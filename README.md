# Baseline for Typescript smart contract

`/src` folder is the main place to write smart contract.

After smart contract is finished, build it with Docker and push to Docker Hub.

The operator can pull the image to install smart contract later.

\*Note: the Dockerfile in this project may not work for Windows.
